      <description>Recall in A1 we proved the following theorem.
 Theorem Let $G$ be a group and $a \in G$ be any element. The map $\phi_a: G \to G$ where $\phi_a(x) = ax$ is a bijection.  We can think of $\phi_a$ as “sliding” the group elements around a group $G$.
Nature extension: “slide” and entire subgroup of $G$ by multiplying every element by a fixed group element.
Cosets A coset of a subgroup $H$ of group $G$ is a set obtained by “translating” $H$ by a group element $a$.</description>

      <description>(see Papantonopoulou, Chapter 4)
We can see the dull power of group theory by studying how a group acts on a set of objects.
e.g. Consider the group $G = GL_n(\R)$, and the set $X = \R_n$. The group $G$ acts on $X$ by multiplying a vector $x \in X$ by a matrix $A\in G$. Moreover, we can see the group structure of $GL_n(\R)$ in the action.
 Up to now our study of groups has been largely focused on the groups themselves.</description>

      <description>Up to now we have studied the structure of individual groups very carefully. In this section we will be interested in determining wither two different group essentially have same structure. (e.g. $\Z_2$ and $({\pm 1}, \times)$)
Consider the groups $\Z_4={0,1,2,3}$ and $\Z_8^* = {1,3,5,7}$. They are obviously different (at least on the surface, they have different operations). Even beyond the surface, these groups differ structurally.
 $\Z_4$ is cyclic, but $\Z_8^*$ is not!</description>

      <description>Let $G$ be a group and $H \le G$. Let $G/H$ be the set of all left cosets of $H$ in $G$.
 Definition - $G/H$ $G/H = { aH : a \in G}$ is the set of all left cosets of $H$.  Q: Can we put an operation on $G/H$ to turn it into a group? How should we define $aH * bH$ for some $a,b \in G$?</description>

      <description>The Cycle Notation Now that we have seen more about groups in general, we can take a closer look at $S_n$.
Recall every $\sigma \in S_n$ can be describe using an array. e.g. $\sigma = \begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;amp;2&amp;amp;3&amp;amp;4&amp;amp;5&amp;amp;6 \\ 2&amp;amp;1&amp;amp;4&amp;amp;6&amp;amp;5&amp;amp;3 \end{pmatrix}$. If we look closely at $\sigma$, we notice something interesting.
Each of these cycle can be written very compactly. $\sigma = (1 2)(3 4 6)(5)$.
e.g.
$\sigma = \begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;amp;2&amp;amp;3&amp;amp;4 \\ 4&amp;amp;3&amp;amp;2&amp;amp;1 \end{pmatrix} = (1 4)(2 3)$</description>

      <description>Theorem 9.1 - The Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups Every finite Abelian group $G$ is isomorphic to $$\Z_{{p_1}^{n_1}} \times \Z_{{p_2}^{n_2}} \times &amp;hellip; \times \Z_{{p_k}^{n_k}}$$ where $p_1, p_2, &amp;hellip;, p_k$ are (not necessarily distinct) primes dividing $|G|$, and $n_1, n_2, &amp;hellip;, n_k$ are positive integers.Moreover, the group $G$ is uniquely determines the number of terms ($k$), as well as the intergers $n_1, n_2, &amp;hellip;, n_k$.  Example 1 Let $G$ be an Abelian group of order $8 = 2^3$.</description>

      <title>Subgroups and Cyclic Groups</title>

      <description>We can find even mor examples of groups with the examples we already know.
e.g. $\Z \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \R \subseteq \mathbb{C}$. All of them form groups under $+$, addition.
e.g. Recall $\Z^={1,-1}$, $\Z^ \subseteq { \pm 1, \pm i} \subseteq \mathbb{C}^*$. They form groups under $\times$ multiplication.
e.g. ${r_0, r_1, r_2, r_3} \subseteq D_4$. It is a group under composition of symmetries (movements).
Subgroup  Definition - Subgroup Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a group.</description>

      <title>Groups</title>

      <description>Informally, a group is a set in which we can “multiply” and “divide”.
First Examples $(\Z, +)$ The integers ${ &amp;hellip;, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, &amp;hellip;}$ form a group under addition.
 $+$ takes two elements of $\Z$ and spits out another element of $\Z$. We say $\Z$ is closed under $+$.  e.g. $1+1=2$, $2+3=5$, $(-1)+1=0$, &amp;hellip;   $0$ is special. $0+a=a$ and $a+0=a$ for any $a \in \Z$.</description>
